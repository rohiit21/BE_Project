                        If you visit my house, you have to be properly dressed. You cannot sit in our drawing room with legs crossed. It is against etiquette. My grandmother is very soft-spoken and gentle. She prepares breakfast and helps us to get ready. Although past sixty, she is very active and hardworking. She takes adequate care of our home and helps in keeping it neat, clean and shining.

 

                        My father works as an accountant in a private firm. He sleeps with a calculator in his pocket. He maintains an account book for the whole family. He can never go to sleep unless he prepares a balance sheet. When we are busy watching TV programs, he can be seen taking everyone to task for not giving a proper account of daily expenses. When my grandmother brings costly fruit, it is balanced by simple meals the next day.
                        
                        My mother is the finest lady in the world. She does not interfere with anything. She works as a receptionist in a private firm. She has to get up very early in the morning. She is always smiling. When she returns home, the smile returns to everyoneâ€™s face. My elder brother is a student of the senior secondary class. He is a very serious student and does not take part in games or other extra-curricular activities which is bad because sports are equally important. His mind is always engrossed in physics, chemistry, and mathematics.
